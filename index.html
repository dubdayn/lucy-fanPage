            <h2>About Lucy</h2>
            <p>
                Lucy is a beautiful black cat. She's an extemely curious and social creature,
                but it hasn't always been this way.

                For most of her life she was riddled with anxiety and hated most people. All of this
                changed when she met her first dog. Even though she was so scared, with a lot of time
                and reassurance, she found that she had the love of a dog inside her as well.

                She now identifies as part dog. Lucy weights just over 10 pounds and stands at about 1 foot tall.

            <h2>What has Lucy inspired?</h2>
            <p>
                Lucy is the primary motivation for all the things that I attempt in life. She has had a hard 
                life, but that doesn't stop her for being the sweetest and most caring baby in the house.
                She is quick to greet everyone who comes inside with a friendly "meow". This is then followed 
                for a demand for food and pets.

                She is the classic example of what love and patience can provide. These are her superpowers.
                For this reason, I've decided to name my own music production and DJ project after her. My official
                stage name is BLVCK KAT music. She's the reason I work so hard in school, at work, and towards my 
                passions.

                Thank you Queen Lucy. I love you!!!
